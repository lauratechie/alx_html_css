# alx_html_css
css_advanced folder
In this project, an adnvanced html code has been written where most of the code has been split into sections, divs for easier styling when it comes to using the CSS.
After running a small confirmation on how the appearance should look like with reference to the Figma wireframe([)](https://www.figma.com/file/dyYL6Ku4WG7vsdpwvlcJZC/Homepage) and running just the html code only, it is good to go!
